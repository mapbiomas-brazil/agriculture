## About
This repository contains scripts used in the classification of the agriculture subclasses, for Mapbiomas Collection 8. We recommend that you read the  [Agriculture Appendix of the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)](https://mapbiomas.org/download-dos-atbds), since important informations about the classification methodology can be found there. For this collection, we have the following agriculture subclasses:

 - Temporary Crop
	- Soybean
	- Cotton
	- Sugar Cane
	- Rice
	- Other Temporary Crop
 - Perennial Crop
	- Coffee
	- Citrus
	- Oil Palm
	- Other Perennial Crop
